This project was one of my first attempts at coding while I was a psychology student. It was for my graduation thesis, and I chose the topic of clinical diagnosis with Bayesian inference because I was impressed by its potential to drastically improve recall and precision. The code is only a minimally viable product, with many, many shortcomings. It is quite repetitive, unnecessarily complicated, and not well commented — it does not follow good coding practice. 

I have it here anyways for two reasons: First, my passion for programming started partly because of the topic of this project, so it’s worth remembering. Second and perhaps more importantly, the minimally viable product can still be modified (probably entirely rewritten) with the same basic idea but better implementation, and hopefully more statistical data support and scaled to make a better program. I plan to keep following this line of work in the future.
