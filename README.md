# Bayesian_ExpertSystem
This project was one of my first attempts at coding while I was a psychology student. It was for my graduation thesis, and I chose the topic of clinical diagnosis with Bayesian inference
because I was impressed by its potential to drastically improve recall and precision. The code is only a minimally viable product.
